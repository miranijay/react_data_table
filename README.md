• Basic Setup & Table Implementation
  • Install the `react-data-table-component` package in a React app.
  • Create a simple table that displays a list of mock data, such as user information (name, email, role, etc.).
  • Create a table using `DataTable` component from `react-data-table-component`.
  • Populate the table with at least 5 rows of data and ensure the data is displayed correctly.

• Sorting & Pagination
  • Implement sorting functionality on at least one column (e.g., sorting by name, email, or date).
  • Use the `sortable` prop for column headers and ensure the sorting works both in ascending and descending order.
  • Add pagination to the table.
  • Display a limited number of rows per page and allow navigation between pages using the pagination controls.
  • Customize the pagination to show a set number of items per page.

• Search/Filter Functionality
  • Implement a search bar above the table that allows filtering the rows based on a text query (e.g., search by name or email).
  • Use state to filter data based on the search query and update the displayed rows dynamically.

• Tooltips
  • Add tooltips to table cells to display additional information when users hover over a cell (e.g., extra user details).
  • Use a tooltip library like `react-tooltip` or `Material-UI` tooltips.

• Row Action Buttons
  • Add action buttons (edit, delete) in each row.
  • Handle click events for these actions and trigger appropriate functionality (e.g., opening an edit form or deleting a row).

• Row Selection & Bulk Actions
  • Implement a row selection feature that allows users to select multiple rows.
  • Add a button for bulk actions (e.g., delete selected items) and handle selected rows appropriately.
